Package: anon-gw-anonymizer-config
Architecture: all
## Workaround: Not using versioned 'Depends:' on 'tor'.
## Ideally we would depend on 'tor (>= 0.2.7.3)' because we are using,
## 'KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth' which is not available in earlier versions.
## It would break the build. Debian jessie only has 'tor' '0.2.5'. Which is
## the only available repository at anon-gw-anonymizer install time.
## (1700_install-packages) The Tor Project's deb repository with Tor 0.2.7 is
## added only afterwards. (2300_run-chroot-scripts-post-d) This workaround can
## likely be removed once Whonix is based on Debian stretch.
